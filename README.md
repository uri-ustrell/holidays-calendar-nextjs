### Holidays Calendar

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Description

Simple calendar that displays the public holidays of a country.

## Notes

I never used Next.JS framework before, so I decided to let apart the state management with Redux. But probably It'd helped implement better practices: define pure functions for calendar inputs, call APIs with error handling, etc.

But if you'd like to see how I implement redux with react:
